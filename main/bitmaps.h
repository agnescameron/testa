    "World Within a World",
    " > Deep within a thick forest, beyond the footpaths and signs, you may come across a gathering of the fairies and their kind. The floor is thick with leaves and the air filled with musk, you try to look through the treetops to catch the sky in dusk. A beautiful sight to witness, fairies cheering and dancing, you don't know what they celebrate but you almost want to join in. Between the twigs and leaves, they move their dancing feet, deep within this woodland on the dancefloor they do meet. They swirl and they twirl, skip gallop and whine, the fairies sense it in the air that it is dancing time. Adorned in leaves and flowers, that some now wear as shirts, they dance and dance and dance until their legs and their feet hurt. The sky is now pitch black, but the fairies twirl some more, you wonder if they will ever stop or if this is forest lore. Jiving, shaking and thriving, they move together as one, you watch in admiration at the fairies having fun. But as you watch them closely, one begins to rise towards the sky, you buckle up with excitement to watch the fairies fly. One after another and another after that, the fairies ascend into darkness and you're not sure if they'll be back. The fairies move as one, just like a flock of birds, they have left the forest floor with not a whisper to be heard. Higher and higher they fly, to where the treetops meet the sky, the fairies disperse and settle, you cannot believe your eyes. Like a cozy winter blanket, they cover the sky above, you can barely see them anymore but you still feel their love. Sat in contemplation, your world starts to zoom out, as you sit and wonder what the fairies' were all about. And as the world around you zooms out more and more, you see it is Verbena leaves that make up the forest floor. And the sky looks more like water, and the mist looks more like steam, you look up to catch the fairies, if they can still be seen. Their wings have become petals, their bodies now a stem, you can't quite count how many but it's surely more than ten. The fairies are now flowers, Limeflower at that, a world had formed within a world, right where you were sat. A special pot is brewing, with forest magic inside, and the potent Limeflower, to make sure you don't hide. The fairies know its powers and use it to dance together, Limeflower paired with Verbena to make them light as a feather."

    " > Join 'Batina' in her Bedroom", 
    "Batina's Borage",
    " > Batina, Batina, Batina, her world is so small but her thoughts are so large. Batina knows only the bed that she is swallowed by and the walls that surround her. Batina who knows each shade of gray by name but has never witnessed a rainbow. Batina who knows the length and width of each crack in her ceiling but has never seen the faces in the clouds. Batina, who's only companion is Batina and who's enemy is Batina. ~~Perhaps today will be the day... Auntie Nayara thinks to herself as she knocks assertively on Batina's bedroom door.~~Batina barely hears the knocks any more, they are as distant as the clouds but not quite as distant as the wind that moves them. The sun is now high in the sky so she proceeds to draw her curtains and block any form of light entering her dark sanctuary. The shadows on the walls taunt her, claiming her as their own as they move closer to her bed. She scurries past her wardrobe; god forbid she catches a glimpse of her reflection and is reminded that there is still life behind her eyes despite her efforts to withdraw. She slithers into bed, making love to the duvet as she enters. Batina's bed is the best thing in her life right now. A reliable, old friend that has held her through the darkest of times. Disappearing into the sheets, she drifts in and out of her thoughts, a new concern for each new crease in her linen. She obsesses, she mourns, she grieves, she cries, she worries, she empathises, she ruminates, she plans, she remembers, she forgets and she sleeps.~~I am sure today is not the day but today I will try anyway... Auntie Nayara mumbles to herself as she knocks passively on Batina's bedroom door.~~Begrudgedly, Batina rises from her slumber. Why face another day when the pain persists anyway, she mumbles to herself. She stares at the same ceiling, picks her fingernails and wallows. This bed of Batina's, despite it being her closest friend, has a sinister way of showing support. Instead of encouraging her to leave its clutch, Bed lures her closer by reminding her that there is a Batina shaped dent whenever she leaves. Bed smells familiar, Bed has snacks and WiFi, Bed provides darkness even when the light shines through the small gap where the curtains meet the wall. Today, Bed has an unusual surprise for Batina - a spider...~~ Batina is not very scared of bugs although she jumps when she sees the spider, less out of fear and more out of shock that her mundane day has been disrupted. Upon closer examination this spider does not look like a common spider, it walks across her bed slowly and intentionally, blinks and tilts its head as if to say hello. I will have to put this strange little thing out of the window, which means opening the curtains... Batina thinks to herself. She scurries to her en-suite bathroom to grab some toilet paper. When she returns, the spider is sitting central on her bed and she could swear that it is looking up at her. As she leans in to scoop it up onto the paper she hears a voice ask 'Why won't you open the door?' Batina is used to hearing voices, every day she is tormented by contradicting thoughts and flickers of guilt for blocking the world out. Because I am afraid that the world will swallow me and I think that my family will take the first bite. Batina says to herself. 'But isn't Bed already swallowing you? Aren't you already devouring yourself?' Slightly taken aback, Batina wonders why she is once again fighting herself, she thought she had got rid of this part of mind a long time ago. Yes, perhaps I am, but at least I know what I taste like here and at least I can swallow at my own pace. 'Batina one of these days you should open the door to Auntie Nayara for she has a gift that tastes sweeter than mango, that you can also swallow at your own pace.'~~If Batina hadn't already had several conversations with her bed and the cracks in her ceiling, she might have been more shocked that this spider was speaking to her. She proceeds to scoop the insect up and walks it across her bedroom. She pulls the curtain back just enough to reach the window handle to open it. The fresh air startles her. She thought about throwing the intrusive spider out of the window but instead decides that she somewhat welcomes its presence. She places it on the windowsill, quickly closes the window and scurries back into Bed. Bed holds her like it usually does, in her Batina shaped dent, but something feels out of place this time.~~I am sure today is not the day but today I will try anyway… Auntie Nayara mumbles to herself as she knocks passively on Batina's bedroom door.~~I am not going to listen to a silly spider. Batina thinks to herself as she ignores the knock. A few days passed, she never saw the spider that she left on her windowsill again but her Batina shaped dent in Bed never felt the same after the encounter.~~I will never stop knocking for my beloved Batina. Auntie Nayara thinks to herself as she knocks passionately on Batina's bedroom door.~~'Yeaaah?' Says a precarious Batina. Auntie Nayara doesn't register that she has a response for she is so used to being met with silence. She could be hearing things but she replies anyway 'I have some tea for you Batina. I know you are struggling, I understand your pain. I'm not even asking you to come downstairs anymore but I am going to leave this tea by your door. We are here for you when you are ready.'~~Batina is still sure that her family wants to devour her and questions if the tea is poisoned but drinks it anyway. It smells like Borage tea, she remembers the scent from her mothers kitchen around the time that Nana passed.~~Auntie Nayara is pretty sure that Batina drank the tea yesterday so she leaves another cup by her door and arrives with a different message than usual today. 'Thank you Batina, may you let the light in.'~~Batina does drink the tea again, mainly because it feels nostalgic and a small part of her is still hoping it is poisoned. The burden of my existence is too much for my family; why eat me when they could poison me... Batina thinks to herself as she sips the Borage tea.~~Feeling more alive than ever, Batina drinks a third, fourth and fifth cup of Borage as the days pass. She still observes the cracks in the ceiling, she still picks her fingernails and she still knows every shade of gray. But as the pot boils and the fresh air sneaks in through the crack in the window, she realises that she is standing in her kitchen, brewing her own pot of Borage tea, far away from Bed, close to Auntie Nayara."

    " > Meet eccentric  'Uncle John'", 
    "Uncle John",
    " > Uncle John is a peculiar Uncle but I love him all the same. He wears oil stained jeans and steel cap boots - inside. His T-shirt usually has a tattered logo and his fleece rarely comes off. He has many flatcaps but his burgundy herringbone one is his favourite and this also rarely comes off. He has a wonky face, minimal hair and piercing blue eyes. I have always loved staying at his house during the holidays. He lives atop a big hill, up some stairs and then up some more stairs, down a long drive, over a tall hedge and through an overgrown yard. His abode is humble, the floorboards creak and the doors hang off their hinges. I have even learned to appreciate the nicotine stained wallpaper that now has pinstripes in every shade of brown. He keeps a collection of videos and DVD's for me to play on his tiny TV and I spend hours looking through his collection of vintage lighters. We have a tradition when I arrive at his house for the summer, he pulls out his big, rusty metal tin from the bottom of the wardrobe and places it in the spare room, which is my bedroom really. The tin is always full to the brim of silver and copper coins. He hands me a handful of plastic money bags and says 'If tha' can count all t' change and get it in those money bags tha' can keep if for spends.' And so I get to work - two, four, six, seven, eight, ten, eleven, sixteen... until I reach one pound. And then another pound and then another. There is always at least twenty quid, generous Uncle John that saves up his change all year just for me.~~We have another tradition - his dream book, but I'll come back to this. Some evenings I sit with him in the lounge, I am usually sprawled out across the rug like a loyal labrador while he sinks deep into his green, velvet armchair. He chain smokes golden virginia roll ups and tells me tales of the local neighbourhood from his childhood. His last roll up, though, is always a little different. He pulls a rizla from the crushed packet and places it on the coffee table. 'Time for my night cap now 'ar kid, it's just about bed time.' He walks to the kitchen, switches the kettle on to boil, opens the spice cupboard and grabs the familiar jar of Nutmeg. He proudly carries it back into the living room with his brew and performs his ritual. He places a small amount of ground Nutmeg into his rizla and rolls it up into a little bomb. 'Uncle John, how do you swallow paper so easily?' 'I've 'ad plenty a' practice.' replies Uncle John with a smirk on his face. He proceeds to drop the Nutmeg filled rizla into his throat and swallows. He takes a large swig of Yorkshire tea to wash it down. Nothing particularly exciting happens after the Nutmeg bomb, we both just go to bed. I always sleep well at Uncle John's house even though I can hear his snores echo through the house all night. We meet on the landing at the top of the narrow staircase in the morning to discuss the happenings of the night before. He pulls out his magical dream book and tells me about his lucid travels. Uncle John can always recite his dreams perfectly, he tells me tales of misty woodlands and friendly trees, streets with no end and familiar family members up to no good. The infamous dream book is actually a lined notepad from Morrisons, it is Uncle John who adds the real magic… or perhaps it can be traced back to the Nutmeg. All I know is that my Uncle befriends Aliens in his sleep, he has travelled the world and outer space, he can talk to animals, and he can see colours that he can't see when he is awake. 'Na then, what did you dream about 'ar lass?' asked Uncle John with anticipation."

    " > Solve 'The mysterious case of the yellow sparrow'", 
    "The Case of the Yellow Sparrow",
    " > It was a humid dusk in Lahore, Inaya played in the back yard with her siblings like she always does. At the moment, the children are enjoying playing 'Doctors' - Hannan pretends to be the sick patient this time, experiencing nausea and fever. Saba drives him in the ambulance to the hospital and places him on the makeshift bed for treatment. 'NEE NOR NEE NOR, I have a patient for you Doctor Inaya, Mr. Hannan is very poorly, is there anything you can do?' Inaya gets to work on her brother, prodding him with twigs from the garden and offering a home-brewed medicine that would surely make his sickness worse if he was to actually drink it. Amidst the hospital chaos, the children see something land at the bottom of the yard. Unsure what it could be, they join hands and walk towards the visitor with a combination of fear and wonder in their stomachs. Upon closer inspection, they see that the unexpected visitor is a little sparrow. The sparrow is clearly injured, it struggles to scurry away from the trio and looks up at them with pleading eyes. 'Its wings are bleeding!' Shouts a concerned Saba. The children feel much empathy for the bird, they have been raised to care for animals like they would a fellow human. Hannan suggests that Inaya may be able to treat it in her hospital. 'I think I could Hannan, but maybe we should ask Mum what to do first.'~~Inaya scoops the Sparrow up into her arms with no hesitation and heads towards the house, her siblings follow close behind. 'Mum!' She shouts. 'We found an injured bird in the yard, come quickly - I think we can help it.' Mum is not sure if the kids are playing 'Doctors' or not so she rushes down from upstairs to see what is the matter. She looks at her children warmly and notices that Inaya really is clutching an injured bird. She can see the visible wound and feels concern for the feeble bird. Mum is also filled with pride, for her children are caring and sensitive just like she had hoped. 'I'm really glad you brought it in, it looks like it has been attacked.' The children look to mum with hope as they quickly realise that Inaya's hospital may not be sufficient this time around. 'It's badly wounded but I think it came to us for a reason, it might have heard about your hospital Inaya.' says mum. The family makes a small shelter for the Sparrow in the kitchen out of an old fruit box and some linen cloth. Mum prepares a special solution for the bird. Marigold oil, turmeric oil and beeswax are added to a pot and then left to cool. Mum prays over the concoction and reminds the children that plants work best as medicine when you bless them and most importantly, believe in them. Mum explains that these specific plants should help heal the bird's wounds, 'If we can help this little Sparrow heal, it might be able to fly back to its family.'~~The children go to bed hopeful that the Sparrow will be there in the morning. Hannan dreams of having a chirpy pet Sparrow in the garden, Saba dreams of the Sparrow laying chicks for them to play with and Inaya dreams of the Sparrow getting better and flying high above their house. When the family rises early the next morning they all hurry downstairs to check on the Sparrow. It is still resting but its wounds look a little better. 'I think the balm is working well for it, would you like to help me apply some more?' asks mum. The family continued to care for the bird over the next few days, religiously applying the turmeric balm. They become acquainted with the bird and enjoy watching its strength increase day by day. It also seems to be changing colour… day by day, a little more yellow.~~The Sparrow stayed with the Sheikh's for a whole week and by day seven it was flying around the kitchen. 'I think it's better.' states mum. 'Yeah, it seems so much happier, it couldn't even walk when it landed in our garden.' responds Hannan. The family feels a fuzz wash over them, a feeling of pride and accomplishment. How magical it is to be able to heal something so gracefully, how warming to watch the Sparrow fly again. 'Are we going to talk about the fact that it is BRIGHT YELLOW?' asks Inaya whimsically. 'I'm sure it's just from the turmeric we have been applying and I am sure it will fade.' replies mum with certainty. Inaya remembers how yellow her Dadi's fingers used to be after preparing turmeric root tea for the family so she trusts her mothers words - even though the sparrow looks like a rubber duck. 'We should let it go back to its family right mum?' asks Saba. 'Yes. We have all become very fond of our little friend but it is much better now and I am sure its family and friends will be so happy to be reunited.' They set the Sparrow free and cheered with delight as they watched the bright yellow bird fly high into the evening sky. The children spend the night preparing a special nest for the garden in case the sparrow ever needs to return.~~A few months pass, the Sparrow has a special place in the Sheikh's heart but they have come to accept that it may not come back to visit. That morning, as the family sat outside eating paya, something magical happened. They look up into the sky to see a flock of Sparrows circling above the house. A flock of… bright yellow Sparrows. There is a moment of tranquil silence as they watch the birds dance in the sky, each more yellow than the next. The family speak no words to each other, for they know exactly who it is that has come to visit.~~The following morning the Sheikhs head to the market for fruits and vegetables. They cannot help but notice the headlines on the papers - ‘FLOCK OF MYSTERIOUS YELLOW SPARROWS FLY HIGH ABOVE LAHORE. Is it a blessing or is it a curse? Either way, residents are bewildered by the case and the local animal trust department is inundated with reports.~~The Sheikhs again, need not speak. They look at each other with a strong sense of knowing and a slight sense of humour. They unanimously decide that the mysterious case of the yellow sparrows will have Lahore guessing forever more."
